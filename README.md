## Build instructions

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR COMPILING THE GAME'S SOURCE CODE!!!

IF YOU WANT TO COMPILE THE GAME YOURSELF, CONTINUE READING!!!

### Installing shit

First you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple). 
The link to that is on the [HaxeFlixel website](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/)

Other installations you'd need is the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root, but here are the one's I'm using as of writing.

```
hscript
flixel-ui
newgrounds
flixel-addons
```

So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install newgrounds`

You'll also need to install polymod. Do this with 

```
haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git
```

### Ignored files

I gitignore the API keys for the game, so that no one can nab them and post fake highscores on the leaderboards. But because of that the game
doesn't compile without it.

Just make a file in `/source` and call it `APIStuff.hx`, and copy paste this into it

```haxe
package;

class APIStuff
{
	public static var API:String = "";
	public static var EncKey:String = "";
}

```

and you should be good to go there.

### Compiling game

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the game. You just need to run 'lime test html5 -debug' in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. (command prompt navigation guide can be found here: [https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480))

To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved. For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run 'lime test linux -debug' and then run the executable file in export/debug/linux/bin. For Windows, you need to install Visual Studio Community 2019. While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
* Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)

This will install about 4GB of crap, but once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug`. Once that command finishes (it takes forever even on a higher end PC), you can run FNF from the .exe file under export\debug\windows\bin
As for Mac, 'lime test mac -debug' should work, if not the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.
